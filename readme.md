##1. **Project Brief** ##
The overall objective for this project, as highlighted in the project brief, is to create a service-oriented architecture for my application using the core modules covered, during training, and all the relevant technologies that will enable the app to perform successfully. Throughout this project I have had the opportunity to utilise a number of supporting tools and technologies. More details on how these technologies have been utilised and implemented can be found in the CI/CD Pipeline provided in this report.


## **2. Architecture of mixology**

For this project, I have created an app that randomly generates an alcoholic beverage and a mixer. It does this in a random order creating a new drink every time the user refreshes the app. My app includes four services: front end, generator 1, generator 2 and back end. Each of these services have their own specific function and interact with one another in order to create a desirable experience for the user. 

The diagram below shows the complex architecture behind this app and how they work together to successfully execute this app.

As you can see my app provides the user with a random alcoholic bevarage and a mixer every time they refreshes the page. I have evidenced my application working in the master GCP with 2 screen shots of this showing 2 different beverages. i have also evidenced my application working with in the Ansible GCP server.

## **4. Testing**
The testing software used for this project was Pytesting- a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy. It is a popular Python testing tool mainly due to its ease of use. By carrying out a variety of tests including both mock tests and unit tests, I was able to ensure the page was running efficiently as well as testing functionality. 


As evidenced below, the testing passed and I was able to achieve a coverage of 88%

##  Evaluation

To further enhance my app, I would add another layer which would populate a name alongside the alcoholic drink. This would result in a more interactive and social experience for users which given the current lock-down situation would be a welcomed add-on. Further time spent on extending my knowledge of Jenkins, will ensure I have a more thorough understanding of the scope of this project which would greatly help me in my career. This application has the potential to be turned into an interactive app which can be used in social settings as a drinking game with the potential main features being added.
